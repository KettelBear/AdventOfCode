# Advent of Code 2021!

### Language

I have chosen once again to do Advent in Code in python. However,
in this AOC, I am learning Elixir. With that being said, I am
initially solving the problem in python because it is my comfort
language, so to speak, then solving it in Elixir. Given the previous
statements, you'll then notice that python prints the answer, which
I copy and paste into the answer box on the website, then use test
assertions in Elixir to validate that I wrote the code correctly.


#### Elixir Note

If the split is `\r\n`, that was when I was working on windows.
If the split is only `\n`, I was working on Mac.
